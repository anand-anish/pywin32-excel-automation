# pywin32-excel-automation (custom functions)
Python has many options for natively creating common Microsoft Office file types including Excel, Word and PowerPoint. Python has the “Python for Windows Extensions” package known as pywin32 that allows us to easily access Window’s Component Object Model (COM) and control Microsoft applications via python. 

This code base is a set of custom functions developed using the "win32com" package in python. It acts a wrapper on top of this package and let's us interact with pivot tables in excel and modify them without explicitly opening the file. 


<i> Please note that I will keep on updating this repo with the additional custom functions. Please feel free to comment in case you have a specific use case, and I will try to incorporate it in the next update</i>
